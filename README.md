Natural Language Processing for the Fake News Challenge

## Dataset

The dataset is made up of 49973 headline-article pairs, where the challenge is to classify these pairs into four classes depending on the relationship between the headline and article:

- Discuss
- Agree
- Disagree
- Unrelated

## Solution

TF-IDF and BERT classification tokens were used as the features and embeddings for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The models implemented include:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Multi-layer Perceptron
- Bidirectional Long-short Term Memory
